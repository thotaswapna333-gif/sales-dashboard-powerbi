# Sales Dashboard – Power BI 📊

A sales performance dashboard built in Power BI.  
Uses an SQL-based data model to generate interactive reports and visuals such as sales by region, category breakdowns, profit trends, and more.  

## Overview

This dashboard provides insights into:  
- Total Sales, Profit, Profit %, and Customer Count  
- Sales by Region  
- Sales by Category and Sub-category  
- Sales and Profit by Customer Segment  
- Sales, Profit, and Discount trends over time  

Ideal for tracking business performance and analyzing sales data across multiple dimensions.

## What’s included

- `Sales Dashboard.pbix` – The main Power BI report file (data model + visuals)  
- Sample data export / SQL schema (if applicable)  
- This README documenting the project  

## How to use

1. Download/clon﻿e the repository to your local machine.  
2. Open `Sales Dashboard.pbix` in :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
3. (If data source is external) Update the data source connection to your database or data storage — for example, a CSV export or SQL server.  
4. Refresh data.  
5. Explore visuals and filter by Region, Category, Segment, Month, etc.  

## Tips & Notes

- If using a database, ensure you have correct credentials and permissions.  
- Power BI visuals may behave differently depending on your data volume — test after connecting real data.  
- Consider enabling data refresh or scheduling refresh if you deploy to :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  

## Suggested Improvements (future versions)

- Add more KPIs (e.g. average order value, returning vs new customers)  
- Add drill-through pages or report tooltips for deeper insights  
- Add parameterization for different time periods (week / quarter / year)  
- Add documentation or comments inside Power BI (for measures and calculations)
